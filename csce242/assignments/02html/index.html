        <h2>Baseball: The Heart of American Sport's</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a sport built on tradition, strategy, and skill. Two teams compete to score runs by hitting a ball and running bases, while the defense works to prevent it. From the crack of the bat to the roar of the crowd, the game brings excitement to fans of all ages.</p>

        <p>The sport has deep cultural roots, especially in the United States, but it also thrives worldwide. Countries like Japan, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic celebrate baseball with as much passion as anywhere else. Its timeless mix of patience, precision, and drama makes it more than just a game—it’s a shared experience across generations.</p>
